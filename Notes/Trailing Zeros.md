If you have ever studied number theory then you have probably come across this problem before.
The Idea is find how many time 10 devides n!. Todo this we will apply the [De Polignac's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Polignac's_formula) to figure out how many 5's and 2's there are in the prime decomposition of n!. Since each even term in n! will contribute at least one 2 we know there will be less 5's in its prime decomposition hence the number of trailing zeros will be equal to the number of 5's in its prime factorization.
